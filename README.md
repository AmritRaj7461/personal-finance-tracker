## 🚀 About The Project

Most personal finance apps are boring, cluttered spreadsheets. **FinancePro** was built to change that. 

Designed with a "Cyber-Glass" aesthetic, FinancePro transforms budget tracking into a premium experience. Whether you are checking your **Network Balance** on a desktop or logging a quick coffee expense on your phone, the UI adapts flawlessly. Every interaction is smoothed over with physics-based animations, making financial management not just easy, but genuinely satisfying.
